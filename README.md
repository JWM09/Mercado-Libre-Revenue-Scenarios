## Purpose of Program

The main purpose of this project is to gain experience with facebook Prophet, as well as google colaboratory.  In my opinion both are quite inconsistent and I do not suggest using them in future classes.  Overall we have been tasked with analyzing historical data for Mercado Libre, and using Prophet to create forecasts going forward.

## Conclusions

Through this exercise, I have discovered that the majority of the search traffic takes place in the late hours of the day (between 11PM and 1AM):

Additionally we have discovered that the busiest day from a sales stanpoint is Wednesday:

Overall I can certainly see the value of developing these types of forecasts, but the structure used this time around was quite frustrating to work with.
